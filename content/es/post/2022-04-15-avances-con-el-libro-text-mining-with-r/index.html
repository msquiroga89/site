<p>Today I finished Chapter 4 of the book <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/preface.html">Text Mining with R</a> by Julia Silge and David Robinson. Since my goal is to serve as practice, I not only include the code but also the comments and the theoretical proposal. In some cases, I also include information about functions or terms that I did not know before.</p>
<p>Each chapter is a rmarkdown file in my github repo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/msquiroga89/TextMiningWithR/blob/main/Cap%201_Tidytext%20format.Rmd">Chapter 1: tidy-text format</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/msquiroga89/TextMiningWithR/blob/main/Cap%202_Sentiment%20analysis%20with%20tidy%20data.Rmd">Chapter 2: Sentiment Analysis</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/msquiroga89/TextMiningWithR/blob/main/Cap%203_Analyzing%20word%20and%20document%20frequency_tf-idf.Rmd">Chapter 3: Word Frequency and Document Frequency Analysis with td-idf</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/msquiroga89/TextMiningWithR/blob/main/Cap%204_Relations%20between%20words_n%20grams%20and%20correlations.Rmd">Chapter 4: Relations between words with n-grams and correlations</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that these materials will be useful to someone who wants to learn about text analysis, but is not so comfortable with English. If you need a hand, I’m happy to help.</p>
