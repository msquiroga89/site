I'm a psycholinguist by the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). I'm currently a PhD student with a grant of the National Council of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET), and a professor in the National University of Hurlingham (UNaHur). I'm writing my master's thesis about Cognitive Psychology and Learning (FLACSO) and in 2020 I've started my PhD in Education (UBA).

My goal is to deepen my knowledge of statistics and data science with R/Rstudio.
