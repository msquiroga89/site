One of my pending debts was always the analysis of texts with R, largely because in my PhD I do corpus analysis. So I decided to start reading the book [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html) by Julia Silge and David Robinson. I'm going to leave my notes (in spanish) and my practice with this material on my [github](https://github.com/msquiroga89/TextMiningWithR).
