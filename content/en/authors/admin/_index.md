I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I've studied psycholinguistics, cognitive psychology and education. Currently I research about language acquisition, specifically child vocabulary, with mixed methods, in [Centro de Interdisciplinario de Investigaciones en Psicología Matemática y Experimental (CIIPME-CONICET)](http://www.ciipme-conicet.gov.ar/wordpress/) . I'm interested in deepening my knowledge about R/RStudio, either for statistic analysis or for other usages, like presentations or web design. I'm part of the Organising Committee of [LatinR: Latinoamerican Conference about R use in Research and Development](https://latin-r.com/).
