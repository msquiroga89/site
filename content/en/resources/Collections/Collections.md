In this section we turn <i>meta</i>: here you will find collections of resources that I liked. Some of them repeat themselves, but nevertheless the thematic focus is still relevant.

-   [R Resources for Begginers and Intermediate Users](https://martindevaux.com/2021/01/r_resources_beginners_intermediate/): I liked this collection because it chooses four areas of knowledge: first steps, data visualization, workflows and Shiny-apps building and hosting. And, if those resources fall short, they mention some other sources to find more advanced resources.

-   [R for Healthcare data analysis](https://healthyr.surgicalinformatics.org/resources.html#resources): a whole set of resources to analyze heald data (<i>R for Health Data Science</i> book, introductory videos, teaching aids, cheatseets and tutorials.
