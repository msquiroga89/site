I'll use this section as a notepad for interesting packages that I find online, so I don't forget about them.

-   [redoc - Reversible Reproducible Documents](https://noamross.github.io/redoc/): it allows a reversible workflow between RMarkdown and Microsoft Word. I haven't tried it yet, but despite it not being stable, I think it's worth a try.

-   [polArverse](https://politicaargentina.github.io/polArverse/): package universe for working with tools and data of Argentinian Politics. It includes packages abouth geography, legislative chambers, electoral data, opinion surveys and speeches.

-   [kableExtra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html): tools for creating HTML tables in RMarkdown.

-   [textshape](https://github.com/trinker/textshape): set of tools for transforming text data in structured format.

-   [grafify](https://grafify-vignettes.netlify.app/): package for plotting ANOVAs and post-hoc comparisons. Because sometimes we have to setp outside of our ggplot2 comfort zone.
